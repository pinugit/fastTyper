## About 

fastTyper is a clone of a famous typing website called monkeytype(which i use regularly), so i decided to make my first project clone of monkeytype. this app is made with react, typescript and tailwindcss. 

any contribution or improvements are encouraged and appreciated, i want to implement the main typing typing mechanism of of typing as closely as possible

## What have I already made 🔥

  - The basic structure of the home page is implemented
  - Typing is working (but backspace and any other shortcut don't work)
  - The paragraph length selector is working 
  - The top bar is somewhat working
  - For now these are the only things that are working 😭

 ## What i am currently working on

 - Making a test completing screen
 - Making the typing area fully functional
 - Make the mode selector working perfectly
 - Thinking of making a docker image so that i can easily share the dev environment


## Anyone who want to run the app( will upload to a domain eventually)

1. First clone this repo (duh!!!!)
2. Then run :
```bash
npm i 
```
   to install all the dependency

3. Then run the dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
4. now you are ready to go.👍
